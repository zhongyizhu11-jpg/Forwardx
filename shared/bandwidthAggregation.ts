/**
 * 多入口带宽加权分流 (bandwidth-weighted entry distribution).
 *
 * Not to be confused with the tunnel's relay bandwidth aggregation, which
 * splits a single connection across several relays. This module distributes
 * *different* clients across entry hosts by capacity; one connection still
 * rides one entry.
 *
 * An entry group gathers several front VPS hosts behind one entry domain. By
 * default every healthy member is published, so client connections land on an
 * arbitrary member and the usable throughput is roughly that of a single VPS.
 *
 * Aggregation mode adds a capacity model on top of that: every member declares
 * an uplink bandwidth, the panel derives a weight per member, and the entry
 * records are emitted so that the share of client connections a member receives
 * tracks the bandwidth it can actually carry. The aggregate throughput of the
 * group then approaches the sum of its members instead of the smallest one.
 *
 * This module holds the pure math and normalization. It has no database or
 * network dependency so both the panel server and the browser can use it.
